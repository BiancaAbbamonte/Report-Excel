# Report-Excel
Create a excel report (report_2021.xlsx) from a dataset of sales from a supermarket using python.
For the report I get from the dataset only the information that its necessary for me (Gender, Product Line, Total) and also creat a chart using these info.
Also added a title for presentation.
